# Bloom-Filter

Basic Java implementation of a Bloom Filter. 

### What it is? 

A bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used for set membership with false positives but no false negatives. 

@llimllib has offered a good explanation of a bloom filter with an example at [link](https://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/).

### Implementation

BloomFilter.java contains the class of the BloomFilter.

BloomUse.java uses an instance of the class for testing.
